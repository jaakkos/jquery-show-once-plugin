Show content only once for user
===============================
jquery-show-once-plugin is a jQuery plugin which can be used to show some content to user just once.
For example you can display the user survey link only to those who have not yet participated. When user click link in side the
content a cookie is added to prevent showing the content agen. It's not foolproof but it's should be good enough for most of the cases. ;)
